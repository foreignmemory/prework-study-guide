## Description

 In motivation to better organize my notes a I learned, as well as create an easy to use/read study guide, i created the Prework Study Guide Webpage.To complete this I learned some HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and how to bring it all togther using git/github. With such a large intake of information on various topics, this will help with internalizing that knowledge more thoroughly.
